JHOVE2
======
The Next-Generation Architecture for Format-Aware Characterization.

## <a name="about"></a>About

JHOVE2 is open source software for format-aware characterization of digital objects. JHOVE2 analyzes digital objects with these questions:
* What is it? (Identification)
* What about it? (Feature extraction)
* What is it, really? (Validation)
* So what? (Assessment)

See our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/opf-labs/jhove2/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions-%28FAQ%29) (FAQ) for more information. 

The original [JHOVE](http://hul.harvard.edu/jhove/) characterization framework is widely used by international digital library programs and preservation repositories. During the course of its extensive use over the past four years, however, a number of limitations imposed by idiosyncrasies of design and implementation have been identified. With funding from the [Library of Congress](http://www.loc.gov/) under its National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program ([NDIIPP](http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/)), the [California Digital Library](http://www.cdlib.org/), [Portico](http://www.portico.org/), and [Stanford University](http://library.stanford.edu/depts/dlss/index.htm) are collaborating on a two year project to develop and deploy a next-generation architecture providing enhanced performance, streamlined APIs, and significant new features. The JHOVE2 project generalizes the concept of format characterization to include identification, validation, feature extraction, and policy-based assessment. The target of this characterization is not a simple digital file, but a (potentially) complex digital object that may be instantiated in multiple files.
